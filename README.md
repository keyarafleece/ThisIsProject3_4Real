# ThisIsProject3_4Real
This is the 3rd project of the second phase of my Android Development Fellowship program. This is also the first app that I have created using Jetpack Compose.

As I work on emersing myself in the Android world, I have run into many podcasts and webseries about different technologies and tools in the Android world. This is how I became acquainted with Jetpack Compose. It has been described as "the biggest thing to happen in Android in the last 10 years," and some big companies have started using it as it has become stable. I became interested in Jetpack after watching this video and promptly took this codelab and started this codelab to learn more about how I could use this to develop my own apps. Basically, Jetpack Compose takes XML out and replaces the View system allowing the developer to code purely in Kotlin. I plan to rebuild this project several times using Jetpack, Flutter and the View System.

Here is a video that I created to show off how far I've come! However, I did not come far enough to have editable OR customizable tasks, but that's just where I am at this point. 

Here are some resources that I used to create this project.
